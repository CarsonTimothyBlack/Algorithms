--PROBLEM--
Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters.

The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order.

For example, if given 1 and 3, find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is also evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3. The answer here would be 6.


--SOLUTION--
function smallestCommons(arr) {
  arr.sort((a,b) => a - b);
  let multArr = [];
  let result = 2;
  for(let i = arr[0]; i <= arr[1]; i++) {
    multArr.push(i);
  }
  function checkDiv(x) {
    return result % x == 0;
  }
  while(!multArr.every(checkDiv)) {
    result++;
  }
  return result;
}

//It was not passing freeCodeCamp final test for smallestCommons(23,18), but I was getting correct result on my own console. May be a bug.

--OTHER--

function smallestCommons(arr) {
  arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return b - a;
  });

  // Create new array and add all values from greater to smaller from the
  // original array.
  var newArr = [];
  for (var i = arr[0]; i >= arr[1]; i--) {
    newArr.push(i);
  }

  // Variables needed declared outside the loops.
  var quot = 0;
  var loop = 1;
  var n;

  // Run code while n is not the same as the array length.
  do {
    quot = newArr[0] * loop * newArr[1];
    for (n = 2; n < newArr.length; n++) {
      if (quot % newArr[n] !== 0) {
        break;
      }
    }

    loop++;
  } while (n !== newArr.length);

  return quot;
}

//This one was passing the test
