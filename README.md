# Algorithms
This is a collection of algorithm problems, some with multiple solutions. These are algorithms I worked on at Codewars, Udemy, and more.

Look at the --PROBLEM-- part first and try to figure it out.

Check your solution against the various solutions in the --SOLUTION-- section.

Have fun!
