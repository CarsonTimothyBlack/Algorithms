--PROBLEM--
One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

--SOLUTION--
function rot13(str) {
  let alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM";
  let newStr = "";
  for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if(/\w/.test(str[i])) {
      let rotter = alpha.indexOf(str[i]);
      newStr += alpha[rotter + 13];
    } else {
      newStr += str[i];
    }
  } return newStr;
}
