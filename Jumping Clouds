--PROBLEM--
Given an array of 0s and 1s. Find the shortest path to the end. You must avoid 1s. You may jump either one or two spaces forward,
as long as you don't land on a 1.

Example: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0] = You can either take 6 steps to pass or 5 (The first jump being two spaces). Your code should output 5.

--SOLUTION--
function jumpingOnClouds(c) {
    var counter = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < c.length; i++) { 
        if (c[i + 2] == 0) {
            counter++;
            i++;
        } else { 
            counter++;
        }
    }
    counter--;
    return counter;
}
