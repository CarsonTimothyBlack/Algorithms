--PROBLEM--
The year is 2088 and the Radical Marxist Socialist People's Party (RMSPP) has just seized power in Brazil.

Their first act in power is absolute wealth equality through coercive redistribution.

Create a function that redistributes all wealth equally among all citizens.

Wealth is represented as an array/list where every index is the wealth of a single citizen. The function should mutate the input such that every index has the same amount of wealth. MUTATE the input array/list, don't return anything.

See example:

wealth = [5, 10, 6]  # This represents:
                     # citizen 1 has wealth 5
                     # citizen 2 has wealth 10
                     # citizen 3 has wealth 6

redistribute_wealth(wealth) # mutates wealth list
wealth => [7, 7, 7] # wealth has now been equally redistributed

--SOLUTION--
function redistributeWealth(wealth) {
  const sum = wealth.reduce((x, y) => x + y);
  const equal = sum/wealth.length;
  for(var i = 0; i < wealth.length; i++) {
    wealth[i] = equal;
  }
}
