--PROBLEM--
Given a number, n, and an array of sock colors (as numbers), return how many pairs of matching colors there are.
Example: (8,[3,4,3,4,5,4,3]) would return 2, as there are at least 1 pair of matching 3s and 1 pair of matching 4s, leaving 3 unmatching socks left.


--SOLUTION--
function sockMerchant(n, ar) {
    let socks = {};
    let counter = 0;
    for (var i of ar) { 
        if (socks[i]) {
            socks[i]++;
        } else { 
            socks[i] = 1;
        }
    }
    for (var x in socks) { 
        counter += Math.floor(socks[x]/2);
    }
    return counter;

}
